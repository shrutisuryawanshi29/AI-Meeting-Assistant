**Project**: Privacy-First Meeting Notes Assistant (MVP)

**Goal**: Record meeting audio, transcribe (local), timestamp segments, extract action items, enable manual diarization (speaker labeling), and create Reminders / Calendar links. Privacy-first: audio & transcripts stored locally and encrypted (basic file protection). Optional cloud enhancement later.

**Prereqs**:
- Xcode 15+ (or 14 with SwiftUI updates)
- iOS 16+ device or Simulator (mic may not work in simulator)
- Add Privacy strings to Info.plist (see below)
